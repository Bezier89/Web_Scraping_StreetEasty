If you are thinking about buying an apartment in the city of New York and rent it out, this project will help you decide which neighborhood you should look into.

I scraped StreetEasy.com on 2/18/2016, and analyzed the unit price for rent and for sale for each neighborhood in NYC.<br\ > 
To see the script for scraping and data manipulation, please view: scrape streeteasy and data manipulation.ipynb<br\ >
